BOOK ONE: 1805<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I<br>
<br>
<br>
"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the<br>
Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,<br>
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by<br>
that Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will have<br>
nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer<br>
my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see<br>
I have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news."<br>
<br>
It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna<br>
Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya<br>
Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man<br>
of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her<br>
reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as<br>
she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in<br>
St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.<br>
<br>
All her invitations without exception, written in French, and<br>
delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:<br>
<br>
"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the<br>
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too<br>
terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10-<br>
Annette Scherer."<br>
<br>
"Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the<br>
least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing<br>
an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had<br>
stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke<br>
in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but<br>
thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a<br>
man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went<br>
up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,<br>
scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the<br>
sofa.<br>
<br>
"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's<br>
mind at rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the<br>
politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even<br>
irony could be discerned.<br>
<br>
"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times<br>
like these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pavlovna. "You are<br>
staying the whole evening, I hope?"<br>
<br>
"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I<br>
must put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is<br>
coming for me to take me there."<br>
<br>
"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these<br>
festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."<br>
<br>
"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would<br>
have been put off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by<br>
force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.<br>
<br>
"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's<br>
dispatch? You know everything."<br>
<br>
"What can one say about it?" replied the prince in a cold,<br>
listless tone. "What has been decided? They have decided that<br>
Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to<br>
burn ours."<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a<br>
stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty<br>
years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an<br>
enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she<br>
did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to<br>
disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile<br>
which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played<br>
round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual<br>
consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor<br>
could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.<br>
<br>
In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna<br>
burst out:<br>
<br>
"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand<br>
things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.<br>
She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious<br>
sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is<br>
the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to<br>
perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble<br>
that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and<br>
crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than<br>
ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must<br>
avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely<br>
on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot<br>
understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has<br>
refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some<br>
secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.<br>
The English have not understood and cannot understand the<br>
self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only<br>
desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And<br>
what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has<br>
always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe<br>
is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg<br>
says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a<br>
trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored<br>
monarch. He will save Europe!"<br>
<br>
She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.<br>
<br>
"I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been<br>
sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the<br>
King of Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you<br>
give me a cup of tea?"<br>
<br>
"In a moment. A propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am<br>
expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,<br>
who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of<br>
the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good<br>
ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He<br>
has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?"<br>
<br>
"I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince. "But tell me,"<br>
he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred<br>
to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive<br>
of his visit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke<br>
to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts<br>
is a poor creature."<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others<br>
were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it<br>
for the baron.<br>
<br>
Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she<br>
nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or<br>
was pleased with.<br>
<br>
"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her<br>
sister," was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.<br>
<br>
As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an<br>
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with<br>
sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious<br>
patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron<br>
Funke beaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.<br>
<br>
The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the<br>
womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna<br>
Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of<br>
a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,<br>
so she said:<br>
<br>
"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came<br>
out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly<br>
beautiful."<br>
<br>
The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.<br>
<br>
"I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer<br>
to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that<br>
political and social topics were ended and the time had come for<br>
intimate conversation- "I often think how unfairly sometimes the<br>
joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid<br>
children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like<br>
him," she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her<br>
eyebrows. "Two such charming children. And really you appreciate<br>
them less than anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them."<br>
<br>
And she smiled her ecstatic smile.<br>
<br>
"I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater would have said I<br>
lack the bump of paternity."<br>
<br>
"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I<br>
am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" (and her<br>
face assumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her<br>
Majesty's and you were pitied...."<br>
<br>
The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,<br>
awaiting a reply. He frowned.<br>
<br>
"What would you have me do?" he said at last. "You know I did all<br>
a father could for their education, and they have both turned out<br>
fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active<br>
one. That is the only difference between them." He said this smiling<br>
in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles<br>
round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse<br>
and unpleasant.<br>
<br>
"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a<br>
father there would be nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna<br>
Pavlovna, looking up pensively.<br>
<br>
"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my<br>
children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That<br>
is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!"<br>
<br>
He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a<br>
gesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.<br>
<br>
"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?"<br>
she asked. "They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and<br>
though I don't feel that weakness in myself as yet,I know a little<br>
person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of<br>
yours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya."<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory<br>
and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a<br>
movement of the head that he was considering this information.<br>
<br>
"Do you know," he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad<br>
current of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand<br>
rubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in<br>
five years, if he goes on like this?" Presently he added: "That's what<br>
we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?"<br>
<br>
"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He<br>
is the well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army<br>
under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is<br>
very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very<br>
unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise<br>
Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutuzov's and will be here<br>
tonight."<br>
<br>
"Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna<br>
Pavlovna's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange<br>
that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-<br>
slafe wigh an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She<br>
is rich and of good family and that's all I want."<br>
<br>
And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised<br>
the maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and<br>
fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.<br>
<br>
"Attendez," said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, "I'll speak to Lise,<br>
young Bolkonski's wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can<br>
be arranged. It shall be on your family's behalf that I'll start my<br>
apprenticeship as old maid."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II<br>
<br>
<br>
Anna Pavlovna's drawing room was gradually filling. The highest<br>
Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age<br>
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.<br>
Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her<br>
father to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a ball dress and<br>
her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess<br>
Bolkonskaya, known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,* was<br>
also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being<br>
pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small<br>
receptions. Prince Vasili's son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart,<br>
whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others had also come.<br>
<br>
<br>
*The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.<br>
<br>
<br>
To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, "You have not yet seen my<br>
aunt," or "You do not know my aunt?" and very gravely conducted him or<br>
her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who<br>
had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to<br>
arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna<br>
Pavlovna mentioned each one's name and then left them.<br>
<br>
Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom<br>
not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of<br>
them cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful<br>
and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of<br>
them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health<br>
of Her Majesty, "who, thank God, was better today." And each<br>
visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left<br>
the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious<br>
duty and did not return to her the whole evening.<br>
<br>
The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a<br>
gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a<br>
delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her<br>
teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming<br>
when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always<br>
the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect- the shortness<br>
of her upper lip and her half-open mouth- seemed to be her own special<br>
and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of<br>
this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life<br>
and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull<br>
dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company<br>
and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were<br>
becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her,<br>
and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her<br>
white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that<br>
day.<br>
<br>
The little princess went round the table with quick, short,<br>
swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her<br>
dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was<br>
doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. "I have brought<br>
my work," said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all<br>
present. "Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick<br>
on me," she added, turning to her hostess. "You wrote that it was to<br>
be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed."<br>
And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed,<br>
dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.<br>
<br>
"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone<br>
else," replied Anna Pavlovna.<br>
<br>
"You know," said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in<br>
French, turning to a general, "my husband is deserting me? He is going<br>
to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?" she<br>
added, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer she<br>
turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.<br>
<br>
"What a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince<br>
Vasili to Anna Pavlovna.<br>
<br>
One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with<br>
close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable<br>
at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout<br>
young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known<br>
grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man<br>
had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had<br>
only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this<br>
was his first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with<br>
the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room.<br>
But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and<br>
fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the<br>
place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was<br>
certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety<br>
could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant<br>
and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else<br>
in that drawing room.<br>
<br>
"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor<br>
invalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her<br>
aunt as she conducted him to her.<br>
<br>
Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look<br>
round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to<br>
the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate<br>
acquaintance.<br>
<br>
Anna Pavlovna's alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the<br>
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty's health.<br>
Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: "Do you know<br>
the Abbe Morio? He is a most interesting man."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very<br>
interesting but hardly feasible."<br>
<br>
"You think so?" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and<br>
get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now<br>
committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady<br>
before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak<br>
to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big<br>
feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the<br>
abbe's plan chimerical.<br>
<br>
"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.<br>
<br>
And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave,<br>
she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch,<br>
ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to<br>
flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands<br>
to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or<br>
there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and<br>
hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna<br>
Pavlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a<br>
too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the<br>
conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid<br>
these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an<br>
anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to<br>
listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to<br>
another group whose center was the abbe.<br>
<br>
Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna<br>
Pavlovna's was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all<br>
the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like<br>
a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of<br>
missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the<br>
self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he<br>
was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he<br>
came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he<br>
stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young<br>
people are fond of doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III<br>
<br>
<br>
Anna Pavlovna's reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed<br>
steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,<br>
beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face<br>
was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company<br>
had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed<br>
round the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the<br>
beautiful Princess Helene, Prince Vasili's daughter, and the little<br>
Princess Bolkonskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump<br>
for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna<br>
Pavlovna.<br>
<br>
The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and<br>
polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out<br>
of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in<br>
which he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up<br>
as a treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a<br>
specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen<br>
it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served<br>
up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly<br>
choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing<br>
the murder of the Duc d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc<br>
d'Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were<br>
particular reasons for Buonaparte's hatred of him.<br>
<br>
"Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte," said Anna Pavlovna,<br>
with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in<br>
the sound of that sentence: "Contez nous cela, Vicomte."<br>
<br>
The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness<br>
to comply. Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone<br>
to listen to his tale.<br>
<br>
"The vicomte knew the duc personally," whispered Anna Pavlovna to of<br>
the guests. "The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur," said she to<br>
another. "How evidently he belongs to the best society," said she to a<br>
third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest<br>
and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef<br>
on a hot dish.<br>
<br>
The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.<br>
<br>
"Come over here, Helene, dear," said Anna Pavlovna to the<br>
beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of<br>
another group.<br>
<br>
The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with<br>
which she had first entered the room- the smile of a perfectly<br>
beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed<br>
with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and<br>
sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her,<br>
not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously<br>
allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and<br>
shapely shoulders, back, and bosom- which in the fashion of those days<br>
were very much exposed- and she seemed to bring the glamour of a<br>
ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was so<br>
lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on<br>
the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too<br>
victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish<br>
its effect.<br>
<br>
"How lovely!" said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted<br>
his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something<br>
extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also<br>
with her unchanging smile.<br>
<br>
"Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience," said he,<br>
smilingly inclining his head.<br>
<br>
The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and<br>
considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the<br>
story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful<br>
round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her<br>
still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond<br>
necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and<br>
whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, at<br>
once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor's<br>
face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.<br>
<br>
The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene.<br>
<br>
"Wait a moment, I'll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking<br>
of?" she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. "Fetch me my workbag."<br>
<br>
There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking<br>
merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in<br>
her seat.<br>
<br>
"Now I am all right," she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she<br>
took up her work.<br>
<br>
Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle<br>
and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.<br>
<br>
Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary<br>
resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that<br>
in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features<br>
were like his sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up by<br>
a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation,<br>
and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the<br>
contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of<br>
sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes,<br>
nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace,<br>
and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.<br>
<br>
"It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, sitting down beside<br>
the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this<br>
instrument he could not begin to speak.<br>
<br>
"Why no, my dear fellow," said the astonished narrator, shrugging<br>
his shoulders.<br>
<br>
"Because I hate ghost stories," said Prince Hippolyte in a tone<br>
which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he<br>
had uttered them.<br>
<br>
He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be<br>
sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was<br>
dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of<br>
cuisse de nymphe effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.<br>
<br>
The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then<br>
current, to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to<br>
Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon<br>
Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress' favors, and that in<br>
his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits<br>
to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc's mercy. The latter<br>
spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by<br>
death.<br>
<br>
The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point<br>
where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies<br>
looked agitated.<br>
<br>
"Charming!" said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the<br>
little princess.<br>
<br>
"Charming!" whispered the little princess, sticking the needle<br>
into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of<br>
the story prevented her from going on with it.<br>
<br>
The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully<br>
prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a<br>
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he<br>
was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to<br>
the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe<br>
about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by<br>
the young man's simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet<br>
theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally,<br>
which was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved.<br>
<br>
"The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of<br>
the people," the abbe was saying. "It is only necessary for one<br>
powerful nation like Russia- barbaric as she is said to be- to place<br>
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its<br>
object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would<br>
save the world!"<br>
<br>
"But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre was beginning.<br>
<br>
At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at<br>
Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The<br>
Italian's face instantly changed and assumed an offensively<br>
affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing<br>
with women.<br>
<br>
"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the<br>
society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have<br>
had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think<br>
of the climate," said he.<br>
<br>
Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the more<br>
conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the<br>
larger circle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV<br>
<br>
<br>
Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew<br>
Bolkonski, the little princess' husband. He was a very handsome<br>
young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features.<br>
Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet,<br>
measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little<br>
wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing<br>
room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look<br>
at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so<br>
tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife.<br>
He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome<br>
face, kissed Anna Pavlovna's hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned<br>
the whole company.<br>
<br>
"You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna Pavlovna.<br>
<br>
"General Kutuzov," said Bolkonski, speaking French and stressing the<br>
last syllable of the general's name like a Frenchman, "has been<br>
pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp...."<br>
<br>
"And Lise, your wife?"<br>
<br>
"She will go to the country."<br>
<br>
"Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?"<br>
<br>
"Andre," said his wife, addressing her husband in the same<br>
coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, "the vicomte has<br>
been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!"<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who<br>
from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with<br>
glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he<br>
looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance<br>
with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre's beaming<br>
face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.<br>
<br>
"There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?" said he to<br>
Pierre.<br>
<br>
"I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. "I will come to supper<br>
with you. May I?" he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the<br>
vicomte who was continuing his story.<br>
<br>
"No, impossible!" said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre's<br>
hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished<br>
to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his<br>
daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.<br>
<br>
"You must excuse me, dear Vicomte," said Prince Vasili to the<br>
Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent<br>
his rising. "This unfortunate fete at the ambassador's deprives me<br>
of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to<br>
leave your enchanting party," said he, turning to Anna Pavlovna.<br>
<br>
His daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly<br>
holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more<br>
radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,<br>
almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.<br>
<br>
"Very lovely," said Prince Andrew.<br>
<br>
"Very," said Pierre.<br>
<br>
In passing Prince Vasili seized Pierre's hand and said to Anna<br>
Pavlovna: "Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a<br>
whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.<br>
Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever<br>
women."<br>
<br>
<br>
Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew<br>
his father to be a connection of Prince Vasili's. The elderly lady who<br>
had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook<br>
Prince Vasili in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had<br>
assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed<br>
only anxiety and fear.<br>
<br>
"How about my son Boris, Prince?" said she, hurrying after him<br>
into the anteroom. "I can't remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me<br>
what news I may take back to my poor boy."<br>
<br>
Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to<br>
the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an<br>
ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might<br>
not go away.<br>
<br>
"What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he<br>
would be transferred to the Guards at once?" said she.<br>
<br>
"Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can," answered<br>
Prince Vasili, "but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I<br>
should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn.<br>
That would be the best way."<br>
<br>
The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of the<br>
best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of<br>
society had lost her former influential connections. She had now<br>
come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her<br>
only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had<br>
obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna's reception and had sat<br>
listening to the vicomte's story. Prince Vasili's words frightened<br>
her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a<br>
moment; then she smiled again and dutched Prince Vasili's arm more<br>
tightly.<br>
<br>
"Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I have never yet asked you for<br>
anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my<br>
father's friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God's sake to<br>
do this for my son- and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,"<br>
she added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry, but promise! I have asked<br>
Golitsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always<br>
were," she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.<br>
<br>
"Papa, we shall be late," said Princess Helene, turning her<br>
beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she<br>
stood waiting by the door.<br>
<br>
Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be<br>
economized if it is to last. Prince Vasili knew this, and having<br>
once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him,<br>
he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using<br>
his influence. But in Princess Drubetskaya's case he felt, after her<br>
second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded<br>
him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the<br>
first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners<br>
that she was one of those women- mostly mothers- who, having once made<br>
up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and<br>
are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour<br>
after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved<br>
him.<br>
<br>
"My dear Anna Mikhaylovna," said he with his usual familiarity and<br>
weariness of tone, "it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask;<br>
but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father's<br>
memory, I will do the impossible- your son shall be transferred to the<br>
Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?"<br>
<br>
"My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you- I knew your<br>
kindness!" He turned to go.<br>
<br>
"Wait- just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards..."<br>
she faltered. "You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich<br>
Kutuzov... recommend Boris to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at<br>
rest, and then..."<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili smiled.<br>
<br>
"No, I won't promise that. You don't know how Kutuzov is pestered<br>
since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that<br>
all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as<br>
adjutants."<br>
<br>
"No, but do promise! I won't let you go! My dear benefactor..."<br>
<br>
"Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,<br>
"we shall be late."<br>
<br>
"Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?"<br>
<br>
"Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?"<br>
<br>
"Certainly; but about Kutuzov, I don't promise."<br>
<br>
"Do promise, do promise, Vasili!" cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went,<br>
with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came<br>
naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.<br>
<br>
Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit<br>
employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone<br>
her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She<br>
returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again<br>
pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her<br>
task was accomplished.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V<br>
<br>
<br>
"And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at<br>
Milan?" asked Anna Pavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people of Genoa<br>
and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and<br>
Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions<br>
of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one's head whirl! It is<br>
as if the whole world had gone crazy."<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a<br>
sarcastic smile.<br>
<br>
"'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!'* They say he was very<br>
fine when he said that," he remarked, repeating the words in<br>
Italian: "'Dio mi l'ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!'"<br>
<br>
<br>
*God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!<br>
<br>
<br>
"I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run<br>
over," Anna Pavlovna continued. "The sovereigns will not be able to<br>
endure this man who is a menace to everything."<br>
<br>
"The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," said the vicomte, polite<br>
but hopeless: "The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis<br>
XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he<br>
became more animated. "And believe me, they are reaping the reward<br>
of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they<br>
are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper."<br>
<br>
And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.<br>
<br>
Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time<br>
through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the<br>
little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde<br>
coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much<br>
gravity as if she had asked him to do it.<br>
<br>
"Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d' azur- maison Conde," said<br>
he.<br>
<br>
The princess listened, smiling.<br>
<br>
"If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the<br>
vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which<br>
he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others<br>
but follows the current of his own thoughts, "things will have gone<br>
too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French<br>
society- I mean good French society- will have been forever destroyed,<br>
and then..."<br>
<br>
He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to<br>
make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna,<br>
who had him under observation, interrupted:<br>
<br>
"The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy which<br>
always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family,<br>
"has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to<br>
choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from<br>
the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the<br>
arms of its rightful king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to the<br>
royalist emigrant.<br>
<br>
"That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. "Monsieur le Vicomte quite<br>
rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it<br>
will be difficult to return to the old regime."<br>
<br>
"From what I have heard," said Pierre, blushing and breaking into<br>
the conversation, "almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to<br>
Bonaparte's side."<br>
<br>
"It is the Buonapartists who say that," replied the vicomte<br>
without looking at Pierre. "At the present time it is difficult to<br>
know the real state of French public opinion.<br>
<br>
"Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic<br>
smile.<br>
<br>
It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his<br>
remarks at him, though without looking at him.<br>
<br>
"'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,'"<br>
Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting<br>
Napoleon's words. "'I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.' I<br>
do not know how far he was justified in saying so."<br>
<br>
"Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "After the murder of the<br>
duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some<br>
people," he went on, turning to Anna Pavlovna, "he ever was a hero,<br>
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and<br>
one hero less on earth."<br>
<br>
Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their<br>
appreciation of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the<br>
conversation, and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say<br>
something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.<br>
<br>
"The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre, "was<br>
a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed<br>
greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole<br>
responsibility of that deed."<br>
<br>
"Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisper.<br>
<br>
"What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows<br>
greatness of soul?" said the little princess, smiling and drawing<br>
her work nearer to her.<br>
<br>
"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices.<br>
<br>
"Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping<br>
his knee with the palm of his hand.<br>
<br>
The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at<br>
his audience over his spectacles and continued.<br>
<br>
"I say so," he continued desperately, "because the Bourbons fled<br>
from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon<br>
alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general<br>
good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life."<br>
<br>
"Won't you come over to the other table?" suggested Anna Pavlovna.<br>
<br>
But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.<br>
<br>
"No," cried he, becoming more and more eager, "Napoleon is great<br>
because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,<br>
preserved all that was good in it- equality of citizenship and freedom<br>
of speech and of the press- and only for that reason did he obtain<br>
power."<br>
<br>
"Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to<br>
commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have<br>
called him a great man," remarked the vicomte.<br>
<br>
"He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he<br>
might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a<br>
great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!" continued Monsieur<br>
Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his<br>
extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.<br>
<br>
"What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...<br>
But won't you come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pavlovna.<br>
<br>
"Rousseau's Contrat social," said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.<br>
<br>
"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas."<br>
<br>
"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," again interjected<br>
an ironical voice.<br>
<br>
"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most<br>
important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation<br>
from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas<br>
Napoleon has retained in full force."<br>
<br>
"Liberty and equality," said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at<br>
last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words<br>
were, "high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who<br>
does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached<br>
liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier?<br>
On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it."<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the<br>
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment<br>
of Pierre's outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was<br>
horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had<br>
not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was<br>
impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the<br>
vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.<br>
<br>
"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the<br>
fact of a great man executing a duc- or even an ordinary man who- is<br>
innocent and untried?"<br>
<br>
"I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask how monsieur explains the<br>
18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at<br>
all like the conduct of a great man!"<br>
<br>
"And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the<br>
little princess, shrugging her shoulders.<br>
<br>
"He's a low fellow, say what you will," remarked Prince Hippolyte.<br>
<br>
Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled.<br>
His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,<br>
his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by<br>
another- a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed<br>
to ask forgiveness.<br>
<br>
The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly<br>
that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested.<br>
All were silent.<br>
<br>
"How do you expect him to answer you all at once?" said Prince<br>
Andrew. "Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish<br>
between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.<br>
So it seems to me."<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of<br>
this reinforcement.<br>
<br>
"One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that Napoleon as a man<br>
was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa<br>
where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but... but there are<br>
other acts which it is difficult to justify."<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness<br>
of Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time<br>
to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to<br>
attend, and asking them all to be seated began:<br>
<br>
"I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to<br>
it. Excuse me, Vicomte- I must tell it in Russian or the point will be<br>
lost...." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian<br>
as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.<br>
Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their<br>
attention to his story.<br>
<br>
"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She<br>
must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was<br>
her taste. And she had a lady's maid, also big. She said..."<br>
<br>
Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with<br>
difficulty.<br>
<br>
"She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a<br>
livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some<br>
calls.'"<br>
<br>
Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long<br>
before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the<br>
narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna<br>
Pavlovna, did however smile.<br>
<br>
"She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat<br>
and her long hair came down...." Here he could contain himself no<br>
longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: "And the whole world<br>
knew...."<br>
<br>
And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had<br>
told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pavlovna<br>
and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in so<br>
agreeably ending Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the<br>
anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about<br>
the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom,<br>
and when and where.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI<br>
<br>
<br>
Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests<br>
began to take their leave.<br>
<br>
Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with<br>
huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, to enter a<br>
drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say<br>
something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he<br>
was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his<br>
own, the general's three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the<br>
plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his<br>
absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it<br>
was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression.<br>
Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that<br>
expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: "I hope to<br>
see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my<br>
dear Monsieur Pierre."<br>
<br>
When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again<br>
everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, "Opinions<br>
are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am."<br>
And everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders<br>
to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened<br>
indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also<br>
come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty,<br>
pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.<br>
<br>
"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold," said the little<br>
princess, taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. "It is settled," she added in<br>
a low voice.<br>
<br>
Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match<br>
she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess'<br>
sister-in-law.<br>
<br>
"I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pavlovna, also in a low tone.<br>
"Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au<br>
revoir!"- and she left the hall.<br>
<br>
Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his<br>
face close to her, began to whisper something.<br>
<br>
Two footmen, the princess' and his own, stood holding a shawl and<br>
a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to<br>
the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of<br>
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as<br>
usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.<br>
<br>
"I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador's," said Prince<br>
Hippolyte "-so dull-. It has been a delightful evening, has it not?<br>
Delightful!"<br>
<br>
"They say the ball will be very good," replied the princess, drawing<br>
up her downy little lip. "All the pretty women in society will be<br>
there."<br>
<br>
"Not all, for you will not be there; not all," said Prince Hippolyte<br>
smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he<br>
even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either<br>
from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after<br>
the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long<br>
time, as though embracing her.<br>
<br>
Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at<br>
her husband. Prince Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did<br>
he seem.<br>
<br>
"Are you ready?" he asked his wife, looking past her.<br>
<br>
Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest<br>
fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out<br>
into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into<br>
the carriage.<br>
<br>
"Princesse, au revoir," cried he, stumbling with his tongue as<br>
well as with his feet.<br>
<br>
The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the<br>
dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince<br>
Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone's way.<br>
<br>
"Allow me, sir," said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,<br>
disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.<br>
<br>
"I am expecting you, Pierre," said the same voice, but gently and<br>
affectionately.<br>
<br>
The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte<br>
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte<br>
whom he had promised to take home.<br>
<br>
"Well, mon cher," said the vicomte, having seated himself beside<br>
Hippolyte in the carriage, "your little princess is very nice, very<br>
nice indeed, quite French," and he kissed the tips of his fingers.<br>
Hippolyte burst out laughing.<br>
<br>
"Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,"<br>
continued the vicomte. "I pity the poor husband, that little officer<br>
who gives himself the airs of a monarch."<br>
<br>
Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, "And you<br>
were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One<br>
has to know how to deal with them."<br>
<br>
<br>
Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew's study like<br>
one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa,<br>
took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was<br>
Caesar's Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it<br>
in the middle.<br>
<br>
"What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be quite ill now,"<br>
said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white<br>
hands.<br>
<br>
Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his<br>
eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.<br>
<br>
"That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in<br>
the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but- I<br>
do not know how to express it... not by a balance of political<br>
power...."<br>
<br>
It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such<br>
abstract conversation.<br>
<br>
"One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have you<br>
at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a<br>
diplomatist?" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.<br>
<br>
Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.<br>
<br>
"Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either the one or the<br>
other."<br>
<br>
"But you must decide on something! Your father expects it."<br>
<br>
Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor,<br>
and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow<br>
his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man, "Now go to<br>
Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to<br>
anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasili, and here is money.<br>
Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything." Pierre<br>
had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not<br>
decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was<br>
speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.<br>
<br>
"But he must be a Freemason," said he, referring to the abbe whom he<br>
had met that evening.<br>
<br>
"That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew again interrupted him, "let us<br>
talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?"<br>
<br>
"No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to<br>
tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for<br>
freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the<br>
army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in<br>
the world is not right."<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre's childish<br>
words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to<br>
such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any<br>
other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question.<br>
<br>
"If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no<br>
wars," he said.<br>
<br>
"And that would be splendid," said Pierre.<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew smiled ironically.<br>
<br>
"Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about..."<br>
<br>
"Well, why are you going to the war?" asked Pierre.<br>
<br>
"What for? I don't know. I must. Besides that I am going..." He<br>
paused. "I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit<br>
me!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII<br>
<br>
<br>
The rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room. Prince<br>
Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it<br>
had had in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room. Pierre removed his feet<br>
from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a<br>
house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose<br>
and politely placed a chair for her.<br>
<br>
"How is it," she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly<br>
and fussily in the easy chair, "how is it Annette never got married?<br>
How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for<br>
saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative<br>
fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!"<br>
<br>
"And I am still arguing with your husband. I can't understand why he<br>
wants to go to the war," replied Pierre, addressing the princess<br>
with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their<br>
intercourse with young women.<br>
<br>
The princess started. Evidently Pierre's words touched her to the<br>
quick.<br>
<br>
"Ah, that is just what I tell him!" said she. "I don't understand<br>
it; I don't in the least understand why men can't live without wars.<br>
How is it that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need<br>
it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is<br>
Uncle's aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well<br>
known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the<br>
Apraksins' I heard a lady asking, 'Is that the famous Prince<br>
Andrew?' I did indeed." She laughed. "He is so well received<br>
everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You<br>
know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were<br>
speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?"<br>
<br>
Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the<br>
conversation, gave no reply.<br>
<br>
"When are you starting?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't hear it spoken of,"<br>
said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had<br>
spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly<br>
ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.<br>
"Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must<br>
be broken off... and then you know, Andre..." (she looked<br>
significantly at her husband) "I'm afraid, I'm afraid!" she whispered,<br>
and a shudder ran down her back.<br>
<br>
Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone<br>
besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a<br>
tone of frigid politeness.<br>
<br>
"What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't understand," said he.<br>
<br>
"There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a<br>
whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up<br>
alone in the country."<br>
<br>
"With my father and sister, remember," said Prince Andrew gently.<br>
<br>
"Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to<br>
be afraid."<br>
<br>
Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a<br>
joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if<br>
she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though<br>
the gist of the matter lay in that.<br>
<br>
"I still can't understand what you are afraid of," said Prince<br>
Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.<br>
<br>
The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.<br>
<br>
"No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have..."<br>
<br>
"Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," said Prince Andrew.<br>
"You had better go."<br>
<br>
The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip<br>
quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about<br>
the room.<br>
<br>
Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise, now at him<br>
and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.<br>
<br>
"Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?" exclaimed the little<br>
princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a<br>
tearful grimace. "I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you<br>
have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the<br>
war and have no pity for me. Why is it?"<br>
<br>
"Lise!" was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an<br>
entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself<br>
regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:<br>
<br>
"You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you<br>
behave like that six months ago?"<br>
<br>
"Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince Andrew still more<br>
emphatically.<br>
<br>
Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened<br>
to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to<br>
bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.<br>
<br>
"Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because... I assure you<br>
I myself have experienced... and so... because... No, excuse me! An<br>
outsider is out of place here... No, don't distress yourself...<br>
Good-by!"<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.<br>
<br>
"No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of<br>
the pleasure of spending the evening with you."<br>
<br>
"No, he thinks only of himself," muttered the princess without<br>
restraining her angry tears.<br>
<br>
"Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch<br>
which indicates that patience is exhausted.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess' pretty<br>
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful<br>
eyes glanced askance at her husband's face, and her own assumed the<br>
timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags<br>
its drooping tail.<br>
<br>
"Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!" she muttered, and lifting her dress with one<br>
hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.<br>
<br>
"Good night, Lise," said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand<br>
as he would have done to a stranger.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII<br>
<br>
<br>
The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre<br>
continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his<br>
forehead with his small hand.<br>
<br>
"Let us go and have supper," he said with a sigh, going to the door.<br>
<br>
They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining<br>
room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and<br>
glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the<br>
newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his<br>
elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as<br>
Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk- as one who<br>
has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak<br>
out.<br>
<br>
"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: never marry<br>
till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable<br>
of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and<br>
have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and<br>
irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing- or<br>
all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be<br>
wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise.<br>
If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you<br>
will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed<br>
except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with<br>
a court lackey and an idiot!... But what's the good?..." and he<br>
waved his arm.<br>
<br>
Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different<br>
and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at<br>
his friend in amazement.<br>
<br>
"My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is an excellent woman, one of<br>
those rare women with whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, what<br>
would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one<br>
to whom I mention this, because I like you."<br>
<br>
As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski<br>
who had lolled in Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with half-closed<br>
eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his<br>
thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in<br>
which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with<br>
brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at<br>
ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of<br>
almost morbid irritation.<br>
<br>
"You don't understand why I say this," he continued, "but it is<br>
the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career," said<br>
he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), "but Bonaparte when he<br>
worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had<br>
nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself<br>
up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And<br>
all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and<br>
torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and<br>
triviality- these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I<br>
am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know<br>
nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic<br>
wit," continued Prince Andrew, "and at Anna Pavlovna's they listen<br>
to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and<br>
those women... If you only knew what those society women are, and<br>
women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial<br>
in everything- that's what women are when you see them in their true<br>
colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were<br>
something in them, but there's nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don't<br>
marry, my dear fellow; don't marry!" concluded Prince Andrew.<br>
<br>
"It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that you, you should<br>
consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have<br>
everything before you, everything. And you..."<br>
<br>
He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he<br>
thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.<br>
<br>
"How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre. He considered his<br>
friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the<br>
highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which<br>
might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always<br>
astonished at Prince Andrew's calm manner of treating everybody, his<br>
extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything,<br>
knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all<br>
at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck<br>
by Andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he<br>
himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a<br>
defect but as a sign of strength.<br>
<br>
Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life,<br>
praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary<br>
to wheels that they may run smoothly.<br>
<br>
"My part is played out," said Prince Andrew. "What's the use of<br>
talking about me? Let us talk about you," he added after a silence,<br>
smiling at his reassuring thoughts.<br>
<br>
That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.<br>
<br>
"But what is there to say about me?" said Pierre, his face<br>
relaxing into a careless, merry smile. "What am I? An illegitimate<br>
son!" He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a<br>
great effort to say this. "Without a name and without means... And<br>
it really..." But he did not say what "it really" was. "For the<br>
present I am free and am all right. Only I haven't the least idea what<br>
I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously."<br>
<br>
Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance- friendly and<br>
affectionate as it was- expressed a sense of his own superiority.<br>
<br>
"I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among<br>
our whole set. Yes, you're all right! Choose what you will; it's all<br>
the same. You'll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up<br>
visiting those Kuragins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so<br>
badly- all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!"<br>
<br>
"What would you have, my dear fellow?" answered Pierre, shrugging<br>
his shoulders. "Women, my dear fellow; women!"<br>
<br>
"I don't understand it," replied Prince Andrew. "Women who are comme<br>
il faut, that's a different matter; but the Kuragins' set of women,<br>
'women and wine' I don't understand!"<br>
<br>
Pierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kuragin's and sharing the<br>
dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to<br>
reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew's sister.<br>
<br>
"Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy<br>
thought, "seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading<br>
such a life I can't decide or think properly about anything. One's<br>
head aches, and one spends all one's money. He asked me for tonight,<br>
but I won't go."<br>
<br>
"You give me your word of honor not to go?"<br>
<br>
"On my honor!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX<br>
<br>
<br>
It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a<br>
cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending<br>
to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more<br>
he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was<br>
light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed<br>
more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre<br>
remembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual set for<br>
cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout,<br>
finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.<br>
<br>
"I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought he.<br>
<br>
But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go<br>
there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so<br>
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so<br>
accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately<br>
occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account,<br>
because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to<br>
come to his gathering; "besides," thought he, "all such 'words of<br>
honor' are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if<br>
one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so<br>
extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all<br>
the same!" Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort,<br>
nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kuragin's.<br>
<br>
Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which<br>
Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the<br>
stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the<br>
anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there<br>
was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the<br>
distance.<br>
<br>
Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet<br>
dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in<br>
which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw<br>
him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the<br>
third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices,<br>
the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine<br>
young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others<br>
were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and<br>
trying to set him at the others.<br>
<br>
"I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one.<br>
<br>
"Mind, no holding on!" cried another.<br>
<br>
"I bet on Dolokhov!" cried a third. "Kuragin, you part our hands."<br>
<br>
"There, leave Bruin alone; here's a bet on."<br>
<br>
"At one draught, or he loses!" shouted a fourth.<br>
<br>
"Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow<br>
who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine<br>
linen shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here<br>
is Petya! Good man!" cried he, addressing Pierre.<br>
<br>
Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,<br>
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober<br>
ring, cried from the window: "Come here; part the bets!" This was<br>
Dolokhov, an officer of the Semenov regiment, a notorious gambler<br>
and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about<br>
him merrily.<br>
<br>
"I don't understand. What's it all about?"<br>
<br>
"Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here," said Anatole,<br>
taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.<br>
<br>
"First of all you must drink!"<br>
<br>
Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows<br>
at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and<br>
listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass<br>
while explaining that Dolokhov was betting with Stevens, an English<br>
naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the<br>
outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.<br>
<br>
"Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, giving Pierre the last<br>
glass, "or I won't let you go!"<br>
<br>
"No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to<br>
the window.<br>
<br>
Dolokhov was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly and<br>
distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself<br>
particularly to Anatole and Pierre.<br>
<br>
Dolokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue<br>
eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore<br>
no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face,<br>
was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely<br>
curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed<br>
firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles<br>
played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this,<br>
together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes,<br>
produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.<br>
Dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though<br>
Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dolokhov lived with him and<br>
had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including<br>
Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dolokhov<br>
could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank,<br>
he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at<br>
that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.<br>
<br>
The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented<br>
anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two<br>
footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions<br>
and shouts of the gentlemen around.<br>
<br>
Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted<br>
to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame,<br>
but could not move it. He smashed a pane.<br>
<br>
"You have a try, Hercules," said he, turning to Pierre.<br>
<br>
Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame<br>
out with a crash.<br>
<br>
"Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on," said Dolokhov.<br>
<br>
"Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?" said Anatole.<br>
<br>
"First-rate," said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who with a bottle of<br>
rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of<br>
the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.<br>
<br>
Dolokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the<br>
window sill. "Listen!" cried he, standing there and addressing those<br>
in the room. All were silent.<br>
<br>
"I bet fifty imperials"- he spoke French that the Englishman might<br>
understand him, but he did, not speak it very well- "I bet fifty<br>
imperials... or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he,<br>
addressing the Englishman.<br>
<br>
"No, fifty," replied the latter.<br>
<br>
"All right. Fifty imperials... that I will drink a whole bottle of<br>
rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on<br>
this spot" (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the<br>
window) "and without holding on to anything. Is that right?"<br>
<br>
"Quite right," said the Englishman.<br>
<br>
Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the<br>
buttons of his coat and looking down at him- the Englishman was short-<br>
began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.<br>
<br>
"Wait!" cried Dolokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill<br>
to attract attention. "Wait a bit, Kuragin. Listen! If anyone else<br>
does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?"<br>
<br>
The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to<br>
accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and<br>
though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on<br>
translating Dolokhov's words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar<br>
of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the<br>
window sill, leaned over, and looked down.<br>
<br>
"Oh! Oh! Oh!" he muttered, looking down from the window at the<br>
stones of the pavement.<br>
<br>
"Shut up!" cried Dolokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad<br>
jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.<br>
<br>
Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it<br>
easily, Dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and<br>
lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he<br>
adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the<br>
right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought<br>
two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was<br>
already quite light. Dolokhov's back in his white shirt, and his curly<br>
head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the<br>
Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older<br>
than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and<br>
angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhov's shirt.<br>
<br>
"I say, this is folly! He'll be killed," said this more sensible<br>
man.<br>
<br>
Anatole stopped him.<br>
<br>
"Don't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed.<br>
Eh?... What then?... Eh?"<br>
<br>
Dolokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands,<br>
arranged himself on his seat.<br>
<br>
"If anyone comes meddling again," said he, emitting the words<br>
separately through his thin compressed lips, "I will throw him down<br>
there. Now then!"<br>
<br>
Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the<br>
bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised<br>
his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped<br>
to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without<br>
taking his eyes from the window and from Dolokhov's back. Anatole<br>
stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways,<br>
pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran<br>
to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to<br>
the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade<br>
though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still.<br>
Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov still sat in the same<br>
position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair<br>
touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted<br>
higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was<br>
emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting<br>
yet further back. "Why is it so long?" thought Pierre. It seemed to<br>
him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov made<br>
a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously;<br>
this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the<br>
sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered<br>
still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the<br>
window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered<br>
his eyes and thought he would never never them again. Suddenly he<br>
was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dolokhov was standing on<br>
the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.<br>
<br>
"It's empty."<br>
<br>
He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.<br>
Dolokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.<br>
<br>
"Well done!... Fine fellow!... There's a bet for you!... Devil<br>
take you!" came from different sides.<br>
<br>
The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the<br>
money. Dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon<br>
the window sill.<br>
<br>
"Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I'll do the same thing!" he<br>
suddenly cried. "Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a<br>
bottle. I'll do it.... Bring a bottle!"<br>
<br>
"Let him do it, let him do it," said Dolokhov, smiling.<br>
<br>
"What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why,<br>
you go giddy even on a staircase," exclaimed several voices.<br>
<br>
"I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of rum!" shouted Pierre, banging<br>
the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb<br>
out of the window.<br>
<br>
They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone<br>
who touched him was sent flying.<br>
<br>
"No, you'll never manage him that way," said Anatole. "Wait a bit<br>
and I'll get round him.... Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow, but<br>
now we are all going to -'s."<br>
<br>
"Come on then," cried Pierre. "Come on!... And we'll take Bruin with<br>
us."<br>
<br>
And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the<br>
ground, and began dancing round the room with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X<br>
<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili kept the promise he had given to Princess<br>
Drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on<br>
the evening of Anna Pavlovna's soiree. The matter was mentioned to the<br>
Emperor, an exception made, and Boris transferred into the regiment of<br>
Semenov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no<br>
appointment to Kutuzov's staff despite all Anna Mikhaylovna's<br>
endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pavlovna's reception Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich<br>
relations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed when in the town and<br>
where her darling Bory, who had only just entered a regiment<br>
of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a<br>
cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a<br>
time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August,<br>
and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join<br>
them on the march to Radzivilov.<br>
<br>
It was St. Natalia's day and the name day of two of the Rostovs- the<br>
mother and the youngest daughter- both named Nataly. Ever since the<br>
morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going<br>
continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostova's big house<br>
on the Povarskaya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself<br>
and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing-room with the<br>
visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one<br>
another in relays.<br>
<br>
The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental<br>
type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing- she had had<br>
twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness,<br>
gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was also<br>
seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the<br>
visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not<br>
considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The<br>
count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.<br>
<br>
"I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher," or "ma chere"- he<br>
called everyone without exception and without the slightest<br>
variation in his tone, "my dear," whether they were above or below him<br>
in rank- "I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose<br>
name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be<br>
offended, ma chere! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come,<br>
mon cher!" These words he repeated to everyone without exception or<br>
variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful,<br>
clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same<br>
quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned<br>
to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair<br>
toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his<br>
hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how<br>
to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the<br>
weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and<br>
sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a<br>
man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see<br>
some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald<br>
patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the<br>
anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the<br>
large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty<br>
people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and<br>
china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would<br>
call Dmitri Vasilevich, a man of good family and the manager of all<br>
his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table<br>
would say: "Well, Dmitri, you'll see that things are all as they<br>
should be? That's right! The great thing is the serving, that's it."<br>
And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.<br>
<br>
"Marya Lvovna Karagina and her daughter!" announced the countess'<br>
gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The<br>
countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with<br>
her husband's portrait on it.<br>
<br>
"I'm quite worn out by these callers. However, I'll see her and no<br>
more. She is so affected. Ask her in," she said to the footman in a<br>
sad voice, as if saying: "Very well, finish me off."<br>
<br>
A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling<br>
daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.<br>
<br>
"Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child...<br>
at the Razumovski's ball... and Countess Apraksina... I was so<br>
delighted..." came the sounds of animated feminine voices,<br>
interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and<br>
the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which<br>
last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of<br>
dresses and say, "I am so delighted... Mamma's health... and<br>
Countess Apraksina... and then, again rustling, pass into the<br>
anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation<br>
was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and<br>
celebrated beau of Catherine's day, Count Bezukhov, and about his<br>
illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna<br>
Pavlovna's reception.<br>
<br>
"I am so sorry for the poor count," said the visitor. "He is in such<br>
bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill<br>
him!"<br>
<br>
"What is that?" asked the countess as if she did not know what the<br>
visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of<br>
Count Bezukhov's distress some fifteen times.<br>
<br>
"That's what comes of a modern education," exclaimed the visitor.<br>
"It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as<br>
he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible<br>
things that he has been expelled by the police."<br>
<br>
"You don't say so!" replied the countess.<br>
<br>
"He chose his friends badly," interposed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Prince<br>
Vasili's son, he, and a certain Dolokhov have, it is said, been up<br>
to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.<br>
Dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezukhov's son sent back<br>
to Moscow. Anatole Kuragin's father managed somehow to get his son's<br>
affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg."<br>
<br>
"But what have they been up to?" asked the countess.<br>
<br>
"They are regular brigands, especially Dolokhov," replied the<br>
visitor. "He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova, such a worthy<br>
woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear<br>
somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some<br>
actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men<br>
do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear<br>
into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the<br>
policeman on his back!"<br>
<br>
"What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!" shouted<br>
the count, dying with laughter.<br>
<br>
"Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?"<br>
<br>
Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.<br>
<br>
"It was all they could do to rescue the poor man," continued the<br>
visitor. "And to think it is Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's son who<br>
amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so<br>
well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has<br>
done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in<br>
spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite<br>
declined: I have my daughters to consider."<br>
<br>
"Why do you say this young man is so rich?" asked the countess,<br>
turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of<br>
inattention. "His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also<br>
is illegitimate."<br>
<br>
The visitor made a gesture with her hand.<br>
<br>
"I should think he has a score of them."<br>
<br>
Princess Anna Mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation,<br>
evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went<br>
on in society.<br>
<br>
"The fact of the matter is," said she significantly, and also in a<br>
half whisper, "everyone knows Count Cyril's reputation.... He has lost<br>
count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite."<br>
<br>
"How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!" remarked the<br>
countess. "I have never seen a handsomer man."<br>
<br>
"He is very much altered now," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "Well, as I<br>
was saying, Prince Vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the<br>
count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to<br>
the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death- and he is<br>
so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from<br>
Petersburg- no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune,<br>
Pierre or Prince Vasili. Forty thousand serfs and millions of<br>
rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasili told me himself.<br>
Besides, Cyril Vladimirovich is my mother's second cousin. He's also<br>
my Bory's godfather," she added, as if she attached no importance at<br>
all to the fact.<br>
<br>
"Prince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on<br>
some inspection business," remarked the visitor.<br>
<br>
"Yes, but between ourselves," said the princess, that is a<br>
pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladimirovich,<br>
hearing how ill he is."<br>
<br>
"But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke," said the count;<br>
and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to<br>
the young ladies. "I can just imagine what a funny figure that<br>
policeman cut!"<br>
<br>
And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly<br>
form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who<br>
always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. "So do come and dine<br>
with us!" he said.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XI<br>
<br>
<br>
Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,<br>
but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they<br>
now rose and took their leave. The visitor's daughter was already<br>
smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when<br>
suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls<br>
running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a<br>
girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin<br>
frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was<br>
evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far.<br>
Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat<br>
collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump<br>
rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.<br>
<br>
The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his<br>
arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.<br>
<br>
"Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing. "My pet, whose name day it<br>
is. My dear pet!"<br>
<br>
"Ma chere, there is a time for everything," said the countess with<br>
feigned severity. "You spoil her, Ilya," she added, turning to her<br>
husband.<br>
<br>
"How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your<br>
name day," said the visitor. "What a charming child," she added,<br>
addressing the mother.<br>
<br>
This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life-<br>
with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook<br>
her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little<br>
legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers- was just at<br>
that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child<br>
is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her<br>
flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla- not paying the<br>
least attention to her severe remark- and began to laugh. She laughed,<br>
and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she<br>
produced from the folds of her frock.<br>
<br>
"Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see..." was all Natasha<br>
managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned<br>
against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter<br>
that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.<br>
<br>
"Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you," said the<br>

mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and<br>
turning to the visitor she added: "She is my youngest girl."<br>
<br>
Natasha, raising her face for a moment from her mother's mantilla,<br>
glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.<br>
<br>
The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it<br>
necessary to take some part in it.<br>
<br>
"Tell me, my dear," said she to Natasha, "is Mimi a relation of<br>
yours? A daughter, I suppose?"<br>
<br>
Natasha did not like the visitor's tone of condescension to childish<br>
things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna's son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest<br>
son; Sonya, the count's fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya,<br>
his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were<br>
obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the<br>
excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the<br>
back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the<br>
conversation had been more amusing than the drawing-room talk of<br>
society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apraksina. Now and then<br>
they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.<br>
<br>
The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from<br>
childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though<br>
not alike. Boris was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had<br>
regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and<br>
an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper<br>
lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas<br>
blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find<br>
something to say, but failed. Boris on the contrary at once found<br>
his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had know that<br>
doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was<br>
broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and<br>
how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he<br>
glanced at Natasha. She turned away from him and glanced at her<br>
younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with<br>
suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she<br>
jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet<br>
would carry her. Boris did not laugh.<br>
<br>
"You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma? Do you want the<br>
carriage?" he asked his mother with a smile.<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready," she answered,<br>
returning his smile.<br>
<br>
Boris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha. The plump<br>
boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been<br>
disturbed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XII<br>
<br>
<br>
The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting<br>
the young lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who was four<br>
years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up<br>
person), were Nicholas and Sonya, the niece. Sonya was a slender<br>
little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by<br>
long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a<br>
tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her<br>
slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her<br>
movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and<br>
by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a<br>
pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful<br>
little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest<br>
in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her<br>
eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to<br>
join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile<br>
could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear<br>
that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy<br>
and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Natasha<br>
and Boris, escape from the drawing room.<br>
<br>
"Ah yes, my dear," said the count, addressing the visitor and<br>
pointing to Nicholas, "his friend Boris has become an officer, and<br>
so for friendship's sake he is leaving the university and me, his<br>
old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there<br>
was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department!<br>
Isn't that friendship?" remarked the count in an inquiring tone.<br>
<br>
"But they say that war has been declared," replied the visitor.<br>
<br>
"They've been saying so a long while," said the count, "and<br>
they'll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My<br>
dear, there's friendship for you," he repeated. "He's joining the<br>
hussars."<br>
<br>
The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.<br>
<br>
"It's not at all from friendship," declared Nicholas, flaring up and<br>
turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. "It is not from<br>
friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation."<br>
<br>
He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were<br>
both regarding him with a smile of approbation.<br>
<br>
"Schubert, the colonel of the Pavlograd Hussars, is dining with us<br>
today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.<br>
It can't be helped!" said the count, shrugging his shoulders and<br>
speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.<br>
<br>
"I have already told you, Papa," said his son, "that if you don't<br>
wish to let me go, I'll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except<br>
in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.- I don't<br>
know how to hide what I feel." As he spoke he kept glancing with the<br>
flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady<br>
visitor.<br>
<br>
The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any<br>
moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.<br>
<br>
"All right, all right!" said the old count. "He always flares up!<br>
This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he<br>
rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,"<br>
he added, not noticing his visitor's sarcastic smile.<br>
<br>
The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karagina turned to<br>
young Rostov.<br>
<br>
"What a pity you weren't at the Arkharovs' on Thursday. It was so<br>
dull without you," said she, giving him a tender smile.<br>
<br>
The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish<br>
smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation<br>
without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the<br>
heart of Sonya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of<br>
his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry<br>
glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the<br>
artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All<br>
Nicholas' animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the<br>
conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find<br>
Sonya.<br>
<br>
"How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their<br>
sleeves!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went<br>
out. "Cousinage- dangereux voisinage;"* she added.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Yes," said the countess when the brightness these young people<br>
had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question<br>
no one had put but which was always in her mind, "and how much<br>
suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might<br>
rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than<br>
the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age,<br>
so dangerous both for girls and boys."<br>
<br>
"It all depends on the bringing up," remarked the visitor.<br>
<br>
"Yes, you're quite right," continued the countess. "Till now I<br>
have always, thank God, been my children's friend and had their full<br>
confidence," said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who<br>
imagine that their children have no secrets from them. "I know I shall<br>
always be my daughters' first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with<br>
his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can't help it), he<br>
will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men."<br>
<br>
"Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters," chimed in the<br>
count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by<br>
deciding that everything was splendid. "Just fancy: wants to be an<br>
hussar. What's one to do, my dear?"<br>
<br>
"What a charming creature your younger girl is," said the visitor;<br>
"a little volcano!"<br>
<br>
"Yes, a regular volcano," said the count. "Takes after me! And<br>
what a voice she has; though she's my daughter, I tell the truth<br>
when I say she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an<br>
Italian to give her lessons."<br>
<br>
"Isn't she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to<br>
train it at that age."<br>
<br>
"Oh no, not at all too young!" replied the count. "Why, our<br>
mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen."<br>
<br>
"And she's in love with Boris already. Just fancy!" said the<br>
countess with a gentle smile, looking at Boris' and went on, evidently<br>
concerned with a thought that always occupied her: "Now you see if I<br>
were to be severe with her and to forbid it... goodness knows what<br>
they might be up to on the sly" (she meant that they would be<br>
kissing), "but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come<br>
running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything.<br>
Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her<br>
elder sister I was stricter."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I was brought up quite differently," remarked the handsome<br>
elder daughter, Countess Vera, with a smile.<br>
<br>
But the smile did not enhance Vera's beauty as smiles generally<br>
do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore<br>
unpleasant, expression. Vera was good-looking, not at all stupid,<br>
quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what<br>
she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone-<br>
the visitors and countess alike- turned to look at her as if wondering<br>
why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.<br>
<br>
"People are always too clever with their eldest children and try<br>
to make something exceptional of them," said the visitor.<br>
<br>
"What's the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too<br>
clever with Vera," said the count. "Well, what of that? She's turned<br>
out splendidly all the same," he added, winking at Vera.<br>
<br>
The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to<br>
dinner.<br>
<br>
"What manners! I thought they would never go," said the countess,<br>
when she had seen her guests out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIII<br>
<br>
<br>
When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the<br>
conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation<br>
in the drawing room, waiting for Boris to come out. She was already<br>
growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not<br>
coming at once, when she heard the young man's discreet steps<br>
approaching neither quickly nor slowly. At this Natasha dashed swiftly<br>
among the flower tubs and hid there.<br>
<br>
Boris paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a<br>
little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror<br>
examined his handsome face. Natasha, very still, peered out from her<br>
ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while<br>
before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natasha<br>
was about to call him but changed her mind. "Let him look for me,"<br>
thought she. Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya, flushed, in tears,<br>
and muttering angrily, came in at the other door. Natasha checked<br>
her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place,<br>
watching- as under an invisible cap- to see what went on in the world.<br>
She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sonya, muttering<br>
to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing-room door. It opened<br>
and Nicholas came in.<br>
<br>
"Sonya, what is the matter with you? How can you?" said he,<br>
running up to her.<br>
<br>
"It's nothing, nothing; leave me alone!" sobbed Sonya.<br>
<br>
"Ah, I know what it is."<br>
<br>
"Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!"<br>
<br>
"So-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like<br>
that, for a mere fancy?" said Nicholas taking her hand.<br>
<br>
Sonya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natasha, not<br>
stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with<br>
sparkling eyes. "What will happen now?" thought she.<br>
<br>
"Sonya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are<br>
everything!" said Nicholas. "And I will prove it to you."<br>
<br>
"I don't like you to talk like that."<br>
<br>
"Well, then, I won't; only forgive me, Sonya!" He drew her to him<br>
and kissed her.<br>
<br>
"Oh, how nice," thought Natasha; and when Sonya and Nicholas had<br>
gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Boris to her.<br>
<br>
"Boris, come here," said she with a sly and significant look. "I<br>
have something to tell you. Here, here!" and she led him into the<br>
conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.<br>
<br>
Boris followed her, smiling.<br>
<br>
"What is the something?" asked he.<br>
<br>
She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had<br>
thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.<br>
<br>
"Kiss the doll," said she.<br>
<br>
Boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not<br>
reply.<br>
<br>
"Don't you want to? Well, then, come here," said she, and went<br>
further in among the plants and threw down the doll. "Closer, closer!"<br>
she whispered.<br>
<br>
She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity<br>
and fear appeared on her flushed face.<br>
<br>
"And me? Would you like to kiss me?" she whispered almost inaudibly,<br>
glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying<br>
from excitement.<br>
<br>
Boris blushed.<br>
<br>
"How funny you are!" he said, bending down to her and blushing still<br>
more, but he waited and did nothing.<br>
<br>
Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him<br>
so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and,<br>
tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.<br>
<br>
Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of<br>
the tubs and stood, hanging her head.<br>
<br>
"Natasha," he said, "you know that I love you, but..."<br>
<br>
"You are in love with me?" Natasha broke in.<br>
<br>
"Yes, I am, but please don't let us do like that.... In another four<br>
years... then I will ask for your hand."<br>
<br>
Natasha considered.<br>
<br>
"Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she counted on her slender<br>
little fingers. "All right! Then it's settled?"<br>
<br>
A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.<br>
<br>
"Settled!" replied Boris.<br>
<br>
"Forever?" said the little girl. "Till death itself?"<br>
<br>
She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the<br>
adjoining sitting room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIV<br>
<br>
<br>
After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she<br>
gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to<br>
invite to dinner all who came "to congratulate." The countess wished<br>
to have a tete-a-tete talk with the friend of her childhood,<br>
Princess Anna Mikhaylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she<br>
returned from Petersburg. Anna Mikhaylovna, with her tear-worn but<br>
pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.<br>
<br>
"With you I will be quite frank," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "There<br>
are not many left of us old friends! That's why I so value your<br>
friendship."<br>
<br>
Anna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused. The countess pressed her<br>
friend's hand.<br>
<br>
"Vera," she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a<br>
favorite, "how is it you have so little tact? Don't you see you are<br>
not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or..."<br>
<br>
The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all<br>
hurt.<br>
<br>
"If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone," she replied<br>
as she rose to go to her own room.<br>
<br>
But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples<br>
sitting, one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully.<br>
Sonya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses<br>
for her, the first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were at<br>
the other window and ceased talking when Vera entered. Sonya and<br>
Natasha looked at Vera with guilty, happy faces.<br>
<br>
It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love;<br>
but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vera.<br>
<br>
"How often have I asked you not to take my things?" she said. "You<br>
have a room of your own," and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.<br>
<br>
"In a minute, in a minute," he said, dipping his pen.<br>
<br>
"You always manage to do things at the wrong time," continued<br>
Vera. "You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt<br>
ashamed of you."<br>
<br>
Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no<br>
one replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered<br>
in the room with the inkstand in her hand.<br>
<br>
"And at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha and<br>
Boris, or between you two? It's all nonsense!"<br>
<br>
"Now, Vera, what does it matter to you?" said Natasha in defense,<br>
speaking very gently.<br>
<br>
She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to<br>
everyone.<br>
<br>
"Very silly," said Vera. "I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!"<br>
<br>
"All have secrets of their own," answered Natasha, getting warmer.<br>
"We don't interfere with you and Berg."<br>
<br>
"I should think not," said Vera, "because there can never be<br>
anything wrong in my behavior. But I'll just tell Mamma how you are<br>
behaving with Boris."<br>
<br>
"Natalya Ilynichna behaves very well to me," remarked Boris. "I have<br>
nothing to complain of."<br>
<br>
"Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that it is really<br>
tiresome," said Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.<br>
(She used the word "diplomat," which was just then much in vogue among<br>
the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) "Why does she<br>
bother me?" And she added, turning to Vera, "You'll never understand<br>
it, because you've never loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a<br>
Madame de Genlis and nothing more" (this nickname, bestowed on Vera by<br>
Nicholas, was considered very stinging), "and your greatest pleasure<br>
is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you<br>
please," she finished quickly.<br>
<br>
"I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors..."<br>
<br>
"Well, now you've done what you wanted," put in Nicholas- "said<br>
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let's go to the<br>
nursery."<br>
<br>
All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.<br>
<br>
"The unpleasant things were said to me," remarked Vera, "I said none<br>
to anyone."<br>
<br>
"Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!" shouted laughing voices<br>
through the door.<br>
<br>
The handsome Vera, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant<br>
effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been<br>
said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and<br>
scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still<br>
colder and calmer.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.<br>
<br>
"Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life is not all roses<br>
either. Don't I know that at the rate we are living our means won't<br>
last long? It's all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the<br>
country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows<br>
what besides! But don't let's talk about me; tell me how you managed<br>
everything. I often wonder at you, Annette- how at your age you can<br>
rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those<br>
ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It's<br>
quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn't possibly<br>
do it."<br>
<br>
"Ah, my love," answered Anna Mikhaylovna, "God grant you never<br>
know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you<br>
love to distraction! One learns many things then," she added with a<br>
certain pride. "That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of<br>
those big people I write a note: 'Princess So-and-So desires an<br>
interview with So and-So,' and then I take a cab and go myself two,<br>
three, or four times- till I get what I want. I don't mind what they<br>
think of me."<br>
<br>
"Well, and to whom did you apply about Bory?" asked the countess.<br>
"You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my<br>
Nicholas is going as a cadet. There's no one to interest himself for<br>
him. To whom did you apply?"<br>
<br>
"To Prince Vasili. He was so kind. He at once agreed to<br>
everything, and put the matter before the Emperor," said Princess Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she<br>
had endured to gain her end.<br>
<br>
"Has Prince Vasili aged much?" asked the countess. "I have not<br>
seen him since we acted together at the Rumyantsovs' theatricals. I<br>
expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days," said<br>
the countess, with a smile.<br>
<br>
"He is just the same as ever," replied Anna Mikhaylovna,<br>
"overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head<br>
at all. He said to me, 'I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear<br>
Princess. I am at your command.' Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very<br>
kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do<br>
anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way<br>
that my position is now a terrible one," continued Anna Mikhaylovna,<br>
sadly, dropping her voice. "My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and<br>
makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a<br>
penny and don't know how to equip Boris." She took out her<br>
handkerchief and began to cry. "I need five hundred rubles, and have<br>
only one twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope<br>
now is in Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov. If he will not assist<br>
his godson- you know he is Bory's godfather- and allow him something<br>
for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I<br>
shall not be able to equip him."<br>
<br>
The countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.<br>
<br>
"I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin," said the princess,<br>
"that here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov so rich, all<br>
alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It's a<br>
burden to him, and Bory's life is only just beginning...."<br>
<br>
"Surely he will leave something to Boris," said the countess.<br>
<br>
"Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.<br>
Still, I will take Boris and go to see him at once, and I shall<br>
speak to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it's<br>
really all the same to me when my son's fate is at stake." The<br>
princess rose. "It's now two o'clock and you dine at four. There<br>
will just be time."<br>
<br>
And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the<br>
most of time, Anna Mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son, and<br>
went into the anteroom with him.<br>
<br>
"Good-by, my dear," said she to the countess who saw her to the<br>
door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, "Wish me<br>
good luck."<br>
<br>
"Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich, my dear?" said the<br>
count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:<br>
"If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the<br>
house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite<br>
him, my dear. We will see how Taras distinguishes himself today. He<br>
says Count Orlov never gave such a dinner as ours will be!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XV<br>
<br>
"My dear Boris," said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna to her son as<br>
Countess Rostova's carriage in which they were seated drove over the<br>
straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril<br>
Vladimirovich Bezukhov's house. "My dear Boris," said the mother,<br>
drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and<br>
tenderly on her son's arm, "be affectionate and attentive to him.<br>
Count Cyril Vladimirovich is your godfather after all, your future<br>
depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you<br>
so well know how to be."<br>
<br>
"If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of<br>
it..." answered her son coldly. "But I have promised and will do it<br>
for your sake."<br>
<br>
Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at the<br>
entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to<br>
be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the<br>
rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady's old<br>
cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses,<br>
and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency<br>
was worse today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.<br>
<br>
"We may as well go back," said the son in French.<br>
<br>
"My dear!" exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand<br>
on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.<br>
<br>
Boris said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without<br>
taking off his cloak.<br>
<br>
"My friend," said Anna Mikhaylovna in gentle tones, addressing the<br>
hall porter, I know Count Cyril Vladimirovich is very ill... that's<br>
why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my<br>
friend... I only need see Prince Vasili Sergeevich: he is staying<br>
here, is he not? Please announce me."<br>
<br>
The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and<br>
turned away.<br>
<br>
"Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich," he called to<br>
a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,<br>
who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.<br>
<br>
The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a<br>
large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes<br>
briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.<br>
<br>
"My dear," she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a<br>
touch, "you promised me!"<br>
<br>
The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.<br>
<br>
They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to<br>
the apartments assigned to Prince Vasili.<br>
<br>
Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall,<br>
were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as<br>
they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and<br>
Prince Vasili came out- wearing a velvet coat with a single star on<br>
his breast, as was his custom when at home- taking leave of a<br>
good-looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg<br>
doctor, Lorrain.<br>
<br>
"Then it is certain?" said the prince.<br>
<br>
"Prince, humanum est errare,* but..." replied the doctor, swallowing<br>
his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.<br>
<br>
<br>
*To err is human.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Very well, very well..."<br>
<br>
Seeing Anna Mikhaylovna and her son, Prince Vasili dismissed the<br>
doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of<br>
inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow<br>
suddenly clouded his mother's face, and he smiled slightly.<br>
<br>
"Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our<br>
dear invalid?" said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive<br>
look fixed on her.<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and<br>
perplexed. Boris bowed politely. Prince Vasili without acknowledging<br>
the bow turned to Anna Mikhaylovna, answering her query by a<br>
movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the<br>
patient.<br>
<br>
"Is it possible?" exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Oh, how awful! It<br>
is terrible to think.... This is my son," she added, indicating Boris.<br>
"He wanted to thank you himself."<br>
<br>
Boris bowed again politely.<br>
<br>
"Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never forget what you<br>
have done for us."<br>
<br>
"I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna," said Prince Vasili, arranging his lace frill, and in<br>
tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed<br>
under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than<br>
he had done in Petersburg at Anna Scherer's reception.<br>
<br>
"Try to serve well and show yourself worthy," added he, addressing<br>
Boris with severity. "I am glad.... Are you here on leave?" he went on<br>
in his usual tone of indifference.<br>
<br>
"I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,"<br>
replied Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque<br>
manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so<br>
quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.<br>
<br>
"Are you living with your mother?"<br>
<br>
"I am living at Countess Rostova's," replied Boris, again adding,<br>
"your excellency."<br>
<br>
"That is, with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina," said<br>
Anna Mikhaylovna.<br>
<br>
"I know, I know," answered Prince Vasili in his monotonous voice. "I<br>
never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that<br>
unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler<br>
too, I am told."<br>
<br>
"But a very kind man, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a pathetic<br>
smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostov deserved this censure,<br>
but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. "What do the<br>
doctors say?" asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again<br>
expressing deep sorrow.<br>
<br>
"They give little hope," replied the prince.<br>
<br>
"And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me<br>
and Boris. He is his godson," she added, her tone suggesting that this<br>
fact ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikhaylovna saw<br>
that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezukhov's<br>
fortune, and hastened to reassure him.<br>
<br>
"If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,"<br>
said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern,<br>
"I know his character: noble, upright... but you see he has no one<br>
with him except the young princesses.... They are still young...." She<br>
bent her head and continued in a whisper: "Has he performed his<br>
final duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can<br>
make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if<br>
he is so ill. We women, Prince," and she smiled tenderly, "always know<br>
how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it<br>
may be for me. I am used to suffering."<br>
<br>
Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he<br>
had done at Anna Pavlovna's, that it would be difficult to get rid<br>
of Anna Mikhaylovna.<br>
<br>
"Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna?" said he. "Let us wait until evening. The doctors are<br>
expecting a crisis."<br>
<br>
"But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the<br>
welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a<br>
Christian..."<br>
<br>
A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses,<br>
the count's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of<br>
her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince<br>
Vasili turned to her.<br>
<br>
"Well, how is he?"<br>
<br>
"Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise..." said the<br>
princess, looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger.<br>
<br>
"Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy<br>
smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece. "I have come, and am<br>
at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have<br>
gone through," and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.<br>
<br>
The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room<br>
as Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position<br>
she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasili<br>
to take a seat beside her.<br>
<br>
"Boris," she said to her son with a smile, "I shall go in to see the<br>
count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile<br>
and don't forget to give him the Rostovs' invitation. They ask him<br>
to dinner. I suppose he won't go?" she continued, turning to the<br>
prince.<br>
<br>
"On the contrary," replied the prince, who had plainly become<br>
depressed, "I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young<br>
man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him."<br>
<br>
He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Boris down one flight<br>
of stairs and up another, to Pierre's rooms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVI<br>
<br>
<br>
Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in<br>
Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and<br>
sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostov's was true.<br>
Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now<br>
been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his<br>
father's house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade<br>
would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father-<br>
who were never favorably disposed toward him- would have used it to<br>
turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his<br>
arrival went to his father's part of the house. Entering the drawing<br>
room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the<br>
ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third<br>
read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading- the one who had met<br>
Anna Mikhaylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were<br>
rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole<br>
on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if<br>
he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading<br>
and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed<br>
precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the<br>
mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her<br>
frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she<br>
foresaw. She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely<br>
able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the<br>
pattern.<br>
<br>
"How do you do, cousin?" said Pierre. "You don't recognize me?"<br>
<br>
"I recognize you only too well, too well."<br>
<br>
"How is the count? Can I see him?" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,<br>
but unabashed.<br>
<br>
"The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently<br>
you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings."<br>
<br>
"Can I see the count?" Pierre again asked.<br>
<br>
"Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see<br>
him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is ready- it is<br>
almost time," she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were<br>
busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,<br>
Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.<br>
<br>
Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed<br>
and said: "Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can<br>
see him."<br>
<br>
And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of<br>
the sister with the mole.<br>
<br>
Next day Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the count's house.<br>
He sent for Pierre and said to him: "My dear fellow, if you are<br>
going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very<br>
badly; that is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very<br>
ill, and you must not see him at all."<br>
<br>
Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole<br>
time in his rooms upstairs.<br>
<br>
When Boris appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his<br>
room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at<br>
the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and<br>
glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his<br>
walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and<br>
gesticulating.<br>
<br>
"England is done for," said he, scowling and pointing his finger<br>
at someone unseen. "Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the<br>
rights of man, is sentenced to..." But before Pierre- who at that<br>
moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just<br>
effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured<br>
London- could pronounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a well-built and<br>
handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left<br>
Moscow when Boris was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten<br>
him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Boris by the<br>
hand with a friendly smile.<br>
<br>
"Do you remember me?" asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile.<br>
"I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not<br>
well."<br>
<br>
"Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,"<br>
answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.<br>
<br>
Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it<br>
necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least<br>
embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.<br>
<br>
"Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today," said he, after a<br>
considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
"Ah, Count Rostov!" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. "Then you are his<br>
son, Ilya? Only fancy, I didn't know you at first. Do you remember how<br>
we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It's such an<br>
age..."<br>
<br>
"You are mistaken," said Boris deliberately, with a bold and<br>
slightly sarcastic smile. "I am Boris, son of Princess Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya. Rostov, the father, is Ilya, and his son is<br>
Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot."<br>
<br>
Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've mixed everything up. One<br>
has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Boris? Of course. Well,<br>
now we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne<br>
expedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon<br>
gets across the Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible.<br>
If only Villeneuve doesn't make a mess of things!<br>
<br>
Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read<br>
the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve's name.<br>
<br>
"We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal<br>
than with politics," said he in his quiet ironical tone. "I know<br>
nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy<br>
with gossip," he continued. "Just now they are talking about you and<br>
your father."<br>
<br>
Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his<br>
companion's sake that the latter might say something he would<br>
afterwards regret. But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly,<br>
looking straight into Pierre's eyes.<br>
<br>
"Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip," Boris went on.<br>
"Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,<br>
though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will..."<br>
<br>
"Yes, it is all very horrid," interrupted Pierre, "very horrid."<br>
<br>
Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say<br>
something disconcerting to himself.<br>
<br>
"And it must seem to you," said Boris flushing slightly, but not<br>
changing his tone or attitude, "it must seem to you that everyone is<br>
trying to get something out of the rich man?"<br>
<br>
"So it does," thought Pierre.<br>
<br>
"But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are<br>
quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are<br>
very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that<br>
your father is rich, I don't regard myself as a relation of his, and<br>
neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him."<br>
<br>
For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he<br>
jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris under the elbow in his quick,<br>
clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Boris, began to speak with a<br>
feeling of mingled shame and vexation.<br>
<br>
"Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I<br>
know very well..."<br>
<br>
But Boris again interrupted him.<br>
<br>
"I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You<br>
must excuse me," said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being<br>
put at ease by him, "but I hope I have not offended you. I always make<br>
it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you<br>
come to dinner at the Rostovs'?"<br>
<br>
And Boris, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and<br>
extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,<br>
became quite pleasant again.<br>
<br>
"No, but I say," said Pierre, calming down, "you are a wonderful<br>
fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you<br>
don't know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we<br>
were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite<br>
understand. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the<br>
courage, but it's splendid. I am very glad to have made your<br>
acquaintance. It's queer," he added after a pause, "that you should<br>
have suspected me!" He began to laugh. "Well, what of it! I hope we'll<br>
get better acquainted," and he pressed Boris' hand. "Do you know, I<br>
have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I<br>
am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?"<br>
<br>
"And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?" asked<br>
Boris with a smile.<br>
<br>
Pierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject, and being of the<br>
same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of<br>
the Boulogne expedition.<br>
<br>
A footman came in to summon Boris- the princess was going. Pierre,<br>
in order to make Boris' better acquaintance, promised to come to<br>
dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his<br>
spectacles into Boris' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing<br>
up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an<br>
imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance<br>
of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man.<br>
<br>
As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a<br>
lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man<br>
and made up his mind that they would be friends.<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her<br>
eyes and her face was tearful.<br>
<br>
"It is dreadful, dreadful!" she was saying, "but cost me what it may<br>
I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be<br>
left like this. Every moment is precious. I can't think why his nieces<br>
put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare<br>
him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you..."<br>
<br>
"Adieu, ma bonne," answered Prince Vasili turning away from her.<br>
<br>
"Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the mother to her son when<br>
they were in the carriage. "He hardly recognizes anybody."<br>
<br>
"I don't understand, Mamma- what is his attitude to Pierre?" asked<br>
the son.<br>
<br>
"The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it."<br>
<br>
"But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!"<br>
<br>
"Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma..."<br>
<br>
"Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!" exclaimed the mother.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVII<br>
<br>
After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count<br>
Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov, Countess Rostova sat for a long time all<br>
alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.<br>
<br>
"What is the matter with you, my dear?" she said crossly to the maid<br>
who kept her waiting some minutes. "Don't you wish to serve me? Then<br>
I'll find you another place."<br>
<br>
The countess was upset by her friend's sorrow and humiliating<br>
poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with<br>
her always found expression in calling her maid "my dear" and speaking<br>
to her with exaggerated politeness.<br>
<br>
"I am very sorry, ma'am," answered the maid.<br>
<br>
"Ask the count to come to me."<br>
<br>
The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look<br>
as usual.<br>
<br>
"Well, little countess? What a saute of game au madere we are to<br>
have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Taras<br>
were not ill-spent. He is worth it!"<br>
<br>
He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands<br>
ruffling his gray hair.<br>
<br>
"What are your commands, little countess?"<br>
<br>
"You see, my dear... What's that mess?" she said, pointing to his<br>
waistcoat. "It's, the saute, most likely," she added with a smile.<br>
"Well, you see, Count, I want some money."<br>
<br>
Her face became sad.<br>
<br>
"Oh, little countess!"... and the count began bustling to get out<br>
his pocketbook.<br>
<br>
"I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles," and taking<br>
out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband's waistcoat.<br>
<br>
"Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who's there?" he called out<br>
in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call<br>
will rush to obey the summons. "Send Dmitri to me!"<br>
<br>
Dmitri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the<br>
count's house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the<br>
room.<br>
<br>
"This is what I want, my dear fellow," said the count to the<br>
deferential young man who had entered. "Bring me..." he reflected a<br>
moment, "yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don't<br>
bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean<br>
ones for the countess."<br>
<br>
"Yes, Dmitri, clean ones, please," said the countess, sighing<br>
deeply.<br>
<br>
"When would you like them, your excellency?" asked Dmitri. "Allow me<br>
to inform you... But, don't be uneasy," he added, noticing that the<br>
count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always<br>
a sign of approaching anger. "I was forgetting... Do you wish it<br>
brought at once?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess."<br>
<br>
"What a treasure that Dmitri is," added the count with a smile<br>
when the young man had departed. "There is never any 'impossible' with<br>
him. That's a thing I hate! Everything is possible."<br>
<br>
"Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,"<br>
said the countess. "But I am in great need of this sum."<br>
<br>
"You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift," said the<br>
count, and having kissed his wife's hand he went back to his study.<br>
<br>
When Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhov's the money,<br>
all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the<br>
countess' little table, and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something<br>
was agitating her.<br>
<br>
"Well, my dear?" asked the countess.<br>
<br>
"Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is<br>
so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word..."<br>
<br>
"Annette, for heaven's sake don't refuse me," the countess began,<br>
with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,<br>
elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.<br>
<br>
Anna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be<br>
ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.<br>
<br>
"This is for Boris from me, for his outfit."<br>
<br>
Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess<br>
wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were<br>
kindhearted, and because they- friends from childhood- had to think<br>
about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....<br>
But those tears were pleasant to them both.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<br>
<br>
Countess Rostova, with her daughters and a large number of guests,<br>
was already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen<br>
into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes.<br>
From time to time he went out to ask: "Hasn't she come yet?" They were<br>
expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, known in society as le<br>
terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but<br>
for common sense and frank plainness of speech. Marya Dmitrievna was<br>
known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and<br>
Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at<br>
her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less<br>
all without exception respected and feared her.<br>
<br>
In the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of<br>
war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the<br>
recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew<br>
it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were<br>
smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his<br>
head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers<br>
with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two<br>
neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.<br>
<br>
One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and<br>
wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a<br>
most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as<br>
if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his<br>
mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his<br>
eyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinshin, a cousin of the countess', a<br>
man with "a sharp tongue" as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to<br>
be condescending to his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer<br>
of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held<br>
his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled<br>
the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This<br>
was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semenov regiment with whom<br>
Boris was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natasha had,<br>
teased her elder sister Vera, speaking of Berg as her "intended."<br>
The count sat between them and listened attentively. His favorite<br>
occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of,<br>
was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two<br>
loquacious talkers at one another.<br>
<br>
"Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlovich,"<br>
said Shinshin, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary<br>
Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases- which was a<br>
peculiarity of his speech. "Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur<br>
l'etat;* you want to make something out of your company?"<br>
<br>
<br>
*You expect to make an income out of the government.<br>
<br>
<br>
"No, Peter Nikolaevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry<br>
the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own<br>
position now, Peter Nikolaevich..."<br>
<br>
Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His<br>
conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain<br>
calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no<br>
direct bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours without<br>
being at all put out of countenance himself or making others<br>
uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he<br>
would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.<br>
<br>
"Consider my position, Peter Nikolaevich. Were I in the cavalry I<br>
should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even<br>
with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and<br>
thirty," said he, looking at Shinshin and the count with a joyful,<br>
pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must<br>
always be the chief desire of everyone else.<br>
<br>
"Besides that, Peter Nikolaevich, by exchanging into the Guards I<br>
shall be in a more prominent position," continued Berg, "and vacancies<br>
occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what<br>
can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a<br>
little aside and to send something to my father," he went on, emitting<br>
a smoke ring.<br>
<br>
"La balance y est...* A German knows how to skin a flint, as the<br>
proverb says," remarked Shinshin, moving his pipe to the other side of<br>
his mouth and winking at the count.<br>
<br>
<br>
*So that squares matters.<br>
<br>
<br>
The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that<br>
Shinshin was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or<br>
indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards<br>
he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps;<br>
how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as<br>
senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular<br>
he was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was<br>
with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not<br>
seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests.<br>
But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naivete of his<br>
youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.<br>
<br>
"Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you go- foot or horse- that<br>
I'll warrant," said Shinshin, patting him on the shoulder and taking<br>
his feet off the sofa.<br>
<br>
Berg smiled joyously. The count, by his guests, went into the<br>
drawing room.<br>
<br>
It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled<br>
guests, expecting the summons to zakuska,* avoid engaging in any<br>
long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in<br>
order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The<br>
host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at<br>
one another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who,<br>
or what, they are waiting for- some important relation who has not yet<br>
arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Hors d'oeuvres.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in<br>
the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come<br>
across, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make<br>
him talk, but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles<br>
as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in<br>
monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did not<br>
notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the<br>
bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering<br>
how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a prank on a<br>
policeman.<br>
<br>
"You have only lately arrived?" the countess asked him.<br>
<br>
"Oui, madame," replied he, looking around him.<br>
<br>
"You have not yet seen my husband?"<br>
<br>
"Non, madame." He smiled quite inappropriately.<br>
<br>
"You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it's very<br>
interesting."<br>
<br>
"Very interesting."<br>
<br>
The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna. The latter<br>
understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and<br>
sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he<br>
answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other<br>
guests were all conversing with one another. "The Razumovskis... It<br>
was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apraksina..." was<br>
heard on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.<br>
<br>
"Marya Dmitrievna?" came her voice from there.<br>
<br>
"Herself," came the answer in a rough voice, and Marya Dmitrievna<br>
entered the room.<br>
<br>
All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very<br>
oldest rose. Marya Dmitrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,<br>
holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood<br>
surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if<br>
rolling them up. Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian.<br>
<br>
"Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to<br>
her children," she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned<br>
all others. "Well, you old sinner," she went on, turning to the<br>
count who was kissing her hand, "you're feeling dull in Moscow, I<br>
daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old<br>
man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up," and she pointed<br>
to the girls. "You must look for husbands for them whether you like it<br>
or not...."<br>
<br>
Well," said she, "how's my Cossack?" (Marya Dmitrievna always called<br>
Natasha a Cossack) and she stroked the child's arm as she came up<br>
fearless and gay to kiss her hand. "I know she's a scamp of a girl,<br>
but I like her."<br>
<br>
She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge<br>
reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed with<br>
the pleasure of her saint's-day fete, turned away at once and<br>
addressed herself to Pierre.<br>
<br>
"Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit," said she, assuming a soft high<br>
tone of voice. "Come here, my friend..." and she ominously tucked up<br>
her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a<br>
childlike way through his spectacles.<br>
<br>
"Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell<br>
your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it's my<br>
evident duty." She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to<br>
follow, for this was dearly only a prelude.<br>
<br>
"A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed<br>
and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,<br>
sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war."<br>
<br>
She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly<br>
keep from laughing.<br>
<br>
"Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?" said Marya<br>
Dmitrievna.<br>
<br>
The count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna, the countess followed<br>
on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them<br>
because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna with Shinshin. Berg gave his arm to Vera. The smiling<br>
Julie Karagina went in with Nicholas. After them other couples<br>
followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children,<br>
tutors, and governesses followed singly. The footmen began moving<br>
about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the<br>
guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count's<br>
household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the<br>
voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of<br>
the table sat the countess with Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna<br>
Mikhaylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At<br>
the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and<br>
Shinshin and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the<br>
long table on one side sat the grownup young people: Vera beside Berg,<br>
and Pierre beside Boris; and on the other side, the children,<br>
tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit<br>
vases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its<br>
light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors' glasses, not<br>
neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her<br>
duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the<br>
pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their<br>
redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies'<br>
end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men's end<br>
the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel<br>
of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much<br>
that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with<br>
tender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a<br>
heavenly feeling. Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the<br>
guests were and exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting<br>
opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a<br>
great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and<br>
went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the<br>
wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in<br>
a napkin, from behind the next man's shoulders and whispered: "Dry<br>
Madeira"... "Hungarian"... or "Rhine wine" as the case might be. Of<br>
the four crystal glasses engraved with the count's monogram that stood<br>
before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with<br>
enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests.<br>
Natasha, who sat opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen<br>
look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the<br>
first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny<br>
lively little girl's look made him inclined to laugh without knowing<br>
why.<br>
<br>
Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Julie Karagina,<br>
to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sonya<br>
wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now<br>
she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what<br>
Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept<br>
looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might<br>
be put upon the children. The German tutor was trying to remember<br>
all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full<br>
description of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt<br>
greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin<br>
passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want<br>
any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand<br>
that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted<br>
it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIX<br>
<br>
<br>
At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more<br>
animated. The colonel told them that the declaration of war had<br>
already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself<br>
seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in<br>
chief.<br>
<br>
"And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?" remarked<br>
Shinshin. "He has stopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be our<br>
turn next."<br>
<br>
The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted<br>
to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshin's<br>
remark.<br>
<br>
"It is for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, speaking with a<br>
German accent, "for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He<br>
declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze<br>
danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as<br>
vell as ze sanctity of its alliances..." he spoke this last word<br>
with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.<br>
<br>
Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he<br>
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:<br>
<br>
... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor's sole and<br>
absolute aim- to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations- has<br>
now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a<br>
new condition for the attainment of that purpose.<br>
<br>
"Zat, my dear sir, is vy..." he concluded, drinking a tumbler of<br>
wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.<br>
<br>
"Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* 'Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but<br>
turn spindles at home!'?" said Shinshin, puckering his brows and<br>
smiling. "Cela nous convient a merveille.*[2] Suvorov now- he knew<br>
what he was about; yet they beat him a plate couture,*[3] and where<br>
are we to find Suvorovs now? Je vous demande un peu,"*[4] said he,<br>
continually changing from French to Russian.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Do you know the proverb?<br>
<br>
*[2] That suits us down to the ground.<br>
<br>
*[3] Hollow.<br>
<br>
*[4] I just ask you that.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!" said the<br>
colonel, thumping the table; "and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen<br>
all vill pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible"...<br>
he dwelt particularly on the word possible... "as po-o-ossible," he<br>
ended, again turning to the count. "Zat is how ve old hussars look<br>
at it, and zere's an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a<br>
young hussar, how do you judge of it?" he added, addressing<br>
Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had<br>
turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.<br>
<br>
"I am quite of your opinion," replied Nicholas, flaming up,<br>
turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as<br>
much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment<br>
facing some great danger. "I am convinced that we Russians must die or<br>
conquer," he concluded, conscious- as were others- after the words<br>
were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for<br>
the occasion and were therefore awkward.<br>
<br>
"What you said just now was splendid!" said his partner Julie.<br>
<br>
Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them<br>
and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.<br>
<br>
Pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded approvingly.<br>
<br>
"That's fine," said he.<br>
<br>
"The young man's a real hussar!" shouted the colonel, again thumping<br>
the table.<br>
<br>
"What are you making such a noise about over there?" Marya<br>
Dmitrievna's deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the<br>
table. "What are you thumping the table for?" she demanded of the<br>
hussar, "and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French<br>
are here?"<br>
<br>
"I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar with a smile.<br>
<br>
"It's all about the war," the count shouted down the table. "You<br>
know my son's going, Marya Dmitrievna? My son is going."<br>
<br>
"I have four sons in the army but still I don't fret. It is all in<br>
God's hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a<br>
battle," replied Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice, which easily carried<br>
the whole length of the table.<br>
<br>
"That's true!"<br>
<br>
Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies' at the one end<br>
and the men's at the other.<br>
<br>
"You won't ask," Natasha's little brother was saying; "I know you<br>
won't ask!"<br>
<br>
"I will," replied Natasha.<br>
<br>
Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She<br>
half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to<br>
what was coming, and turning to her mother:<br>
<br>
"Mamma!" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,<br>
audible the whole length of the table.<br>
<br>
"What is it?" asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her<br>
daughter's face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her<br>
sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.<br>
<br>
The conversation was hushed.<br>
<br>
"Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" and Natasha's voice<br>
sounded still more firm and resolute.<br>
<br>
The countess tried to frown, but could not. Marya Dmitrievna shook<br>
her fat finger.<br>
<br>
"Cossack!" she said threateningly.<br>
<br>
Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at<br>
the elders.<br>
<br>
"You had better take care!" said the countess.<br>
<br>
"Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" Natasha again cried<br>
boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken<br>
in good part.<br>
<br>
Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter.<br>
<br>
"You see! I have asked," whispered Natasha to her little brother and<br>
to Pierre, glancing at him again.<br>
<br>
"Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said Marya Dmitrievna.<br>
<br>
Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even<br>
Marya Dmitrievna.<br>
<br>
"Marya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don't like ice<br>
cream."<br>
<br>
"Carrot ices."<br>
<br>
"No! What kind, Marya Dmitrievna? What kind?" she almost screamed;<br>
"I want to know!"<br>
<br>
Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the<br>
guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrievna's answer<br>
but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who<br>
had dared to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion.<br>
<br>
Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be<br>
pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band<br>
again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests,<br>
leaving their seats, went up to "congratulate" the countess, and<br>
reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the<br>
children, and with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs<br>
scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with<br>
redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the<br>
count's study.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XX<br>
<br>
<br>
The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the<br>
count's visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,<br>
some in the sitting room, some in the library.<br>
<br>
The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty<br>
from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at<br>
everything. The young people, at the countess' instigation, gathered<br>
round the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played<br>
first. After she had played a little air with variations on the<br>
harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Natasha and<br>
Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing<br>
something. Natasha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was<br>
evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.<br>
<br>
"What shall we sing?" she said.<br>
<br>
"'The Brook,'" suggested Nicholas.<br>
<br>
"Well, then,let's be quick. Boris, come here," said Natasha. "But<br>
where is Sonya?"<br>
<br>
She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room<br>
ran to look for her.<br>
<br>
Running into Sonya's room and not finding her there, Natasha ran<br>
to the nursery, but Sonya was not there either. Natasha concluded that<br>
she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage<br>
was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the<br>
Rostov household. And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward on<br>
Nurse's dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy<br>
pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and<br>
sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook.<br>
Natasha's face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint's<br>
day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed<br>
down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.<br>
<br>
"Sonya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!" And<br>
Natasha's large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she<br>
began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sonya was<br>
crying. Sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and<br>
hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natasha wept, sitting on the<br>
blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort<br>
Sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.<br>
<br>
"Nicholas is going away in a week's time, his... papers... have<br>
come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry," and she<br>
showed a paper she held in her hand- with the verses Nicholas had<br>
written, "still, I should not cry, but you can't... no one can<br>
understand... what a soul he has!"<br>
<br>
And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.<br>
<br>
"It's all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and<br>
Boris also," she went on, gaining a little strength; "he is nice...<br>
there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...<br>
one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it<br>
can't be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma" (Sonya looked upon the<br>
countess as her mother and called her so) "that I am spoiling<br>
Nicholas' career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God<br>
is my witness," and she made the sign of the cross, "I love her so<br>
much, and all of you, only Vera... And what for? What have I done to<br>
her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice<br>
everything, only I have nothing...."<br>
<br>
Sonya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in<br>
the feather bed. Natasha began consoling her, but her face showed that<br>
she understood all the gravity of her friend's trouble.<br>
<br>
"Sonya," she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true<br>
reason of her friend's sorrow, "I'm sure Vera has said something to<br>
you since dinner? Hasn't she?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some<br>
others, and she found them on my table and said she'd show them to<br>
Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him<br>
to marry me, but that he'll marry Julie. You see how he's been with<br>
her all day... Natasha, what have I done to deserve it?..."<br>
<br>
And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natasha<br>
lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began<br>
comforting her.<br>
<br>
"Sonya, don't believe her, darling! Don't believe her! Do you<br>
remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting<br>
room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don't<br>
quite remember how, but don't you remember that it could all be<br>
arranged and how nice it all was? There's Uncle Shinshin's brother has<br>
married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.<br>
And Boris says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all<br>
about it. And he is so clever and so good!" said Natasha. "Don't you<br>
cry, Sonya, dear love, darling Sonya!" and she kissed her and laughed.<br>
"Vera's spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she<br>
won't say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he<br>
doesn't care at all for Julie."<br>
<br>
Natasha kissed her on the hair.<br>
<br>
Sonya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it<br>
seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin<br>
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.<br>
<br>
"Do you think so?... Really? Truly?" she said, quickly smoothing her<br>
frock and hair.<br>
<br>
"Really, truly!" answered Natasha, pushing in a crisp lock that<br>
had strayed from under her friend's plaits.<br>
<br>
Both laughed.<br>
<br>
"Well, let's go and sing 'The Brook.'"<br>
<br>
"Come along!"<br>
<br>
"Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!" said<br>
Natasha, stopping suddenly. "I feel so happy!"<br>
<br>
And she set off at a run along the passage.<br>
<br>
Sonya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the<br>
verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran<br>
after Natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face<br>
and light, joyous steps. At the visitors' request the young people<br>
sang the quartette, "The Brook," with which everyone was delighted.<br>
Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:<br>
<br>
<br>
   At nighttime in the moon's fair glow<br>
     How sweet, as fancies wander free,<br>
   To feel that in this world there's one<br>
     Who still is thinking but of thee!<br>
<br>
   That while her fingers touch the harp<br>
     Wafting sweet music music the lea,<br>
   It is for thee thus swells her heart,<br>
     Sighing its message out to thee...<br>
<br>
   A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,<br>
     But oh! till then I cannot live!...<br>
<br>
<br>
He had not finished the last verse before the young people began<br>
to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and<br>
the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pierre was sitting in the drawing-room where Shinshin had engaged<br>
him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political<br>
conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre.<br>
When the music began Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre<br>
said, laughing and blushing:<br>
<br>
"Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers."<br>
<br>
"I am afraid of mixing the figures," Pierre replied; "but if you<br>
will be my teacher..." And lowering his big arm he offered it to the<br>
slender little girl.<br>
<br>
While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning<br>
up, Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly<br>
happy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She<br>
was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a<br>
grown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had<br>
given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman<br>
(heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her<br>
partner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan.<br>
<br>
"Dear, dear! Just look at her!" exclaimed the countess as she<br>
crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.<br>
<br>
Natasha blushed and laughed.<br>
<br>
"Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be<br>
surprised at?"<br>
<br>
<br>
In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs<br>
being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya<br>
Dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more<br>
distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves<br>
after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks,<br>
entered the ballroom. First came Marya Dmitrievna and the count,<br>
both with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony<br>
somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Marya Dmitrievna. He<br>
drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and<br>
as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clapped<br>
his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing<br>
the first violin:<br>
<br>
"Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?"<br>
<br>
This was the count's favorite dance, which he had danced in his<br>
youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the<br>
anglaise.)<br>
<br>
"Look at Papa!" shouted Natasha to the whole company, and quite<br>
forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her<br>
curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her<br>
laughter.<br>
<br>
And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure<br>
at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout<br>
partner, Marya Dmitrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened<br>
his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot,<br>
and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more,<br>
prepared the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the<br>
provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling<br>
those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of<br>
the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs- the men on<br>
one side and the women on the other- who with beaming faces had come<br>
to see their master making merry.<br>
<br>
"Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!" loudly remarked<br>
the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.<br>
<br>
The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did<br>
not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her<br>
powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the<br>
countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the<br>
dance. What was expressed by the whole of the count's plump figure, in<br>
Marya Dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming<br>
face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and more<br>
into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness<br>
of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on<br>
his light feet, Marya Dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight<br>
exertions- the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms<br>
when turning, or stamp her foot- which everyone appreciated in view of<br>
her size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and<br>
livelier. The other couples could not attract a moment's attention<br>
to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were<br>
watching the count and Marya Dmitrievna. Natasha kept pulling everyone<br>
by sleeve or dress, urging them to "look at Papa!" though as it was<br>
they never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the<br>
dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the<br>
musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more<br>
lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Marya<br>
Dmitrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his<br>
partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft<br>
foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a<br>
wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led<br>
by Natasha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping<br>
their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.<br>
<br>
"That's how we used to dance in our time, ma chere," said the count.<br>
<br>
"That was a Daniel Cooper!" exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, tucking up<br>
her sleeves and puffing heavily.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXI<br>
<br>
<br>
While in the Rostovs' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being<br>
danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while<br>
tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezukhov had<br>
a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a<br>
mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man,<br>
preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there<br>
was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside<br>
the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid<br>
whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important<br>
order for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of Moscow, who<br>
had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the<br>
count's health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to<br>
the celebrated grandee of Catherine's court, Count Bezukhov.<br>
<br>
The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up<br>
respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an<br>
hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging<br>
their bows and trying to escape as quickly as from the glances fixed<br>
on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince<br>
Vasili, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days,<br>
escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times<br>
in low tones.<br>
<br>
When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasili sat down all<br>
alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the<br>
other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his<br>
hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him<br>
with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the<br>
long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the<br>
eldest princess.<br>
<br>
Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous<br>
whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying<br>
man's room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or<br>
expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.<br>
<br>
"The limits of human life... are fixed and may not be o'erpassed,"<br>
said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was<br>
listening naively to his words.<br>
<br>
"I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?" asked the<br>
lady, adding the priest's clerical title, as if she had no opinion<br>
of her own on the subject.<br>
<br>
"Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament, "replied the priest, passing<br>
his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his<br>
bald head.<br>
<br>
"Who was that? The Military Governor himself?" was being asked at<br>
the other side of the room. "How young-looking he is!"<br>
<br>
"Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes<br>
anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction."<br>
<br>
"I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times."<br>
<br>
The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes<br>
red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a<br>
graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a<br>
table.<br>
<br>
"Beautiful," said the doctor in answer to a remark about the<br>
weather. "The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow<br>
one feels as if one were in the country."<br>
<br>
"Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a sigh. "So he may have<br>
something to drink?"<br>
<br>
Lorrain considered.<br>
<br>
"Has he taken his medicine?"<br>
<br>
"Yes."<br>
<br>
The doctor glanced at his watch.<br>
<br>
"Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,"<br>
and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.<br>
<br>
"Dere has neffer been a gase," a German doctor was saying to an<br>
aide-de-camp, "dat one liffs after de sird stroke."<br>
<br>
"And what a well-preserved man he was!" remarked the aide-de-camp.<br>
"And who will inherit his wealth?" he added in a whisper.<br>
<br>
"It von't go begging," replied the German with a smile.<br>
<br>
Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second<br>
princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to<br>
Lorrain's instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.<br>
<br>
"Do you think he can last till morning?" asked the German,<br>
addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.<br>
<br>
Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger<br>
before his nose.<br>
<br>
"Tonight, not later," said he in a low voice, and he moved away with<br>
a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to<br>
understand and state the patient's condition.<br>
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess' room.<br>
<br>
In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning<br>
before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt<br>
pastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture,<br>
whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white<br>
feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to<br>
bark.<br>
<br>
"Ah, is it you, cousin?"<br>
<br>
She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely<br>
smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and<br>
covered with varnish.<br>
<br>
"Has anything happened?" she asked. "I am so terrified."<br>
<br>
"No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about<br>
business, Catiche,"* muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on<br>
the chair she had just vacated. "You have made the place warm, I<br>
must say," he remarked. "Well, sit down: let's have a talk."<br>
<br>
<br>
*Catherine.<br>
<br>
<br>
"I thought perhaps something had happened," she said with her<br>
unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the<br>
prince, she prepared to listen.<br>
<br>
"I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can't."<br>
<br>
"Well, my dear?" said Prince Vasili, taking her hand and bending<br>
it downwards as was his habit.<br>
<br>
It was plain that this "well?" referred to much that they both<br>
understood without naming.<br>
<br>
The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for<br>
her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasili with no sign of emotion<br>
in her prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up<br>
at the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an<br>
expression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting<br>
before long. Prince Vasili understood it as an expression of<br>
weariness.<br>
<br>
"And I?" he said; "do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn<br>
out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a<br>
very serious talk."<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,<br>
now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant<br>
expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His<br>
eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly<br>
and at the next glanced round in alarm.<br>
<br>
The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony<br>
hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasili's eyes evidently resolved<br>
not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.<br>
<br>
"Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semenovna,"<br>
continued Prince Vasili, returning to his theme, apparently not<br>
without an inner struggle; "at such a moment as this one must think of<br>
everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love<br>
you all, like children of my own, as you know."<br>
<br>
The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the<br>
same dull expression.<br>
<br>
"And then of course my family has also to be considered," Prince<br>
Vasili went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at<br>
her. "You know, Catiche, that we- you three sisters, Mamontov, and<br>
my wife- are the count's only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it<br>
is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me;<br>
but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for<br>
anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count," pointing<br>
to his portrait, "definitely demanded that he should be called."<br>
<br>
Prince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess, but could not<br>
make out whether she was considering what he had just said or<br>
whether she was simply looking at him.<br>
<br>
"There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin," she<br>
replied, "and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow<br>
his noble soul peacefully to leave this..."<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes, of course," interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently,<br>
rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little<br>
table that he had pushed away. "But... in short, the fact is... you<br>
know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he<br>
left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre."<br>
<br>
"He has made wills enough!" quietly remarked the princess. "But he<br>
cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate."<br>
<br>
"But, my dear," said Prince Vasili suddenly, clutching the little<br>
table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: "what if<br>
a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for<br>
Pierre's legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of<br>
the count's services, his request would be granted?..."<br>
<br>
The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about<br>
the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.<br>
<br>
"I can tell you more," continued Prince Vasili, seizing her hand,<br>
"that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew<br>
of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not,<br>
then as soon as all is over," and Prince Vasili sighed to intimate<br>
what he meant by the words all is over, "and the count's papers are<br>
opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and<br>
the petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything<br>
as the legitimate son."<br>
<br>
"And our share?" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if<br>
anything might happen, only not that.<br>
<br>
"But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be<br>
the legal heir to everything and you won't get anything. You must<br>
know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether<br>
they have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been<br>
overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them,<br>
because..."<br>
<br>
"What next?" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and<br>
not changing the expression of her eyes. "I am a woman, and you<br>
think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot<br>
